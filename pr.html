Overview
</h2>
</div>
<p>The KneeKarePro is a brace for ACL recovery patients. The brace
combines hardware and software to collect a patient’s rotary data. The
data is then uploaded to a web app for a clinician to review.</p>
<div id="ui" data-align="center">
<h2>
User Experience
</h2>
</div>
<p>The production release of KneeKarePro was designed to maximize
usability, ensuring that both clinicians and patients can interact with
the system effortlessly. To achieve this, the team focused on
simplifying the setup and operation of the device. The KneeKarePro
module was made fully attachable, with clear assembly instructions
provided to guide consumers through the process. This ensures that users
can independently set up the device without requiring specialized
technical knowledge.</p>
<p>On the software side, the frontend was designed to be straightforward
and easy to navigate. The interface provides clearly labeled controls
and intuitive data visualizations, making it accessible to users with
varying levels of technical expertise. These features allow users to
track their rehabilitation progress seamlessly and without
confusion.</p>
<p>While the current production release does not include a dedicated
mobile application, the framework developed during this phase lays a
strong foundation for future app development. This addition, while
technically straightforward, was deprioritized in favor of refining the
existing features and ensuring a polished release.</p>
<p>The team’s focus on creating a user-friendly experience ensures that
the production release of KneeKarePro is intuitive, accessible, and
effective for its intended users, supporting their rehabilitation goals
with minimal barriers.</p>
<p>The user interaction with Knee Kare device was redesigned and pivoted
to a persistent and easily accessible mode. The hardware and firmware
were redesigned allowing for a more hands-off approach</p>
<div id="interface" data-align="center">
<h3>
Interface
</h3>
</div>
<p>The production release of KneeKarePro features a polished and
user-friendly interface designed to make interaction with the system
straightforward and efficient. On the hardware side, the modular casing
includes clear visual indicators and step-by-step assembly instructions,
ensuring users can easily attach the device to standard knee braces
without technical assistance.</p>
<p>The software frontend provides intuitive navigation, with clearly
labeled controls and accessible features such as real-time angle
measurements and CSV file downloads. Consistent visual cues highlight
active states and guide users through their interactions, enhancing
clarity and usability.</p>
<p>Every interface element was tested extensively to ensure it functions
smoothly and meets user needs. While a mobile application is not yet
available, the current web-based interface delivers all core
functionalities reliably, supporting a seamless user experience.</p>
<div id="nav" data-align="center">
<h3>
Navigation
</h3>
</div>
<p>The KneeKarePro production release includes a straightforward
navigation system that provides users with the tools they need without
unnecessary complexity. The web-based frontend offers two primary
sections: one for clinicians and one for patients. This separation
ensures that both user groups can easily access the features relevant to
their needs.</p>
<p>The clinician section allows for real-time monitoring of patient
data, including visualized progress and detailed reports. The patient
section focuses on personal progress tracking and rehabilitation goals.
Transitioning between these sections is seamless, with clear and
accessible controls guiding users through the system.</p>
<p>While the navigation is simple, it effectively meets the project’s
goals by allowing users to quickly access their desired features with
minimal effort. This design supports the project’s emphasis on usability
and ensures both clinicians and patients can achieve their objectives
efficiently.</p>
<div id="perception" data-align="center">
<h3>
Perception
</h3>
</div>
<p>The KneeKarePro production release prioritizes an intuitive user
experience, ensuring that both patients and clinicians can interact with
the system effectively and with confidence. Feedback from multiple
rounds of user testing indicated that the device and interface were easy
to understand and navigate, even for first-time users.</p>
<p>Sensory feedback plays a key role in enhancing the device’s
intuitiveness. For example, visual indicators confirm successful data
uploads and downloads, while error messages provide clear instructions
for resolving issues. These cues reduce user frustration and help
maintain a seamless workflow. The separation between the clinician and
patient sections also enhances clarity, as each user group is presented
with information and features tailored to their specific needs.</p>
<p>User testing revealed that the system aligns well with user
expectations, with participants noting its straightforward design and
ease of access. Minor adjustments, such as refining labels and improving
visual feedback for state changes, were implemented based on this
feedback. These refinements ensure that the device supports users in
achieving their rehabilitation goals with minimal effort or
confusion.</p>
<p>By focusing on clear sensory feedback and intuitive design, the
production release of KneeKarePro helps users feel confident and engaged
in their rehabilitation journey, meeting its goal of providing an
effective and frustration-free experience.</p>
<div id="resp" data-align="center">
<h3>
Responsiveness
</h3>
</div>
<p>The production release of KneeKarePro is designed to ensure a
responsive and straightforward user experience. The system reliably
displays real-time data transmitted from the device without delays or
interruptions. Users can connect to the local network seamlessly and
access accurate knee angle measurements through the interface.</p>
<p>The simplicity of the interface ensures that users are presented with
only the necessary information, reducing potential confusion. Real-time
data updates occur smoothly, and the system has been thoroughly tested
to eliminate errors or glitches. As a result, users can trust that the
data displayed is accurate and consistent with their movements.</p>
<p>On the hardware side, data is logged and stored in real time, with
seamless synchronization between the device and the frontend interface.
The focus on reliability and simplicity ensures that both clinicians and
patients can interact with the system without encountering technical
difficulties or delays. Through rigorous testing and attention to
detail, the KneeKarePro system ensures a responsive and efficient
experience, supporting the needs of its users without unnecessary
